 Introduction

<h3> The reason at which I have made this guide is because many CWs are made each day and the community is filled with mistakes upon mistakes. Such examples include selling sources which they have absolutely 0 ownership over, ratting, logging and or any other immoral actions. At this point it seems as if the community is a bad influence to younger teens and we experience more and more unecessary issues each day. </h3>
