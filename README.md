 Introduction
  </u>
  </h2>
<a> The reason that I have made this guide is because many CWs are made each day and the community is filled with mistakes upon mistakes. Such examples include selling sources which they have absolutely 0 ownership over, ratting, logging and or any other immoral actions. At this point it seems as if the community is a bad influence to younger teens and we experience more and more unnecessary  issues each day. This guide is used in order to help a person who wishes to get into exploiting and possibly contribute to the community in a way whilst staying safe from exposure or unnecessary  drama. This guide will have more advice given from people who have experienced this community for years and saw it change.<br> </br> TLDR: Bad people, bad influence and bad morals caused me to make this. </a>

  Terms & Definitions

</h2>
<li>
  Skid - An individual which enjoys to steal code (without providing credit to the original owner of the code) and not learn from what they copy paste. These individuals are fairly common in this community and usually show up to dll source releases
</li>
  <br>
  </br>
<li>
  CW - An abreviation for "Community Warning", a community warning essentually warns the community within a specific platform of your wrongdoings / actions and this later leads to repfucking.
</li>
<br>
</br>
<li>
  Spoon Feeding - A form of giving an individual code without letting them understand how to make it function or without letting them digest the knowledge by themselves. This usually leads to skidding.
</li>
<br>
</br>
<li>
  Repfucking - A way to ruin one's reputation, this means people losing faith, trust and respect for you. This is usually caused by "CW"s.
</li>

<li>
  ServerSide - A filtering enabled bypass, a serverside is essentially a game executor which can bypass Roblox's filtering enabled feature which was added in 2017-2018.

 Rules & Principles
  </u>
  </h2>
<ol type="1">
  <li> Synapse Dickriders have absolutely 0 knowledge on the concept upon exploiting. Their general idea is that Synapse X is the best exploit and nothing can compete. </li>
  <br>
  </br>
  <li> Don't attempt to steal code from others and <b> sell </b> it. This will result in either a cw being made or other consequences to occur. Trust is more valuable than a couple bucks. </li> 
  <br>
  </br>
  <li> Remember that some things just shouldn't be released, such as a WeAreDevs API exploit. The community understands you wish to contribute and be noticed but this isn't a release which is needed! </li>
<br>
  </br>
  <li> Leaking or releasing something which isn't yours for revenge isn't respectable or admirable unless the individual has done harm to you or a group of people. Leaking a source can lead to a cw or repfucking. </li>
<br>
  </br>
  <li> Don't act like you are smarter or in anyway more intelligible than other developers when all you know is to copy & paste C++ sources such as Axon or Calamari. </li>
<br>
  </br>
  <li> Don't overhype / excite exploit users over a new product, providing the truth to the product gives better understanding over why the exploit isn't "perfect". Honesty is what matters. </li>
